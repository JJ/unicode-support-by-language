# Unicode support by programming language

This is intended to be a user-editable list of support of Unicode
features by language. Just do PR and add a row, or maybe a column if
you find something missing. If possible, put a link to the place where
that feature is described or an example. In principle, you should
include a language if it includes it in the core or core libraries. If
you want to add something that needs an installable library, it's your
call.
